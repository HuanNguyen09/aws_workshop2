#### Testing the Solution

1. Start by opening **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** and running the **createData.py** script. This script contains the code to generate mock data for testing. By running this script, we will generate data related to traffic flow on different routes.

2. Next, open the web page that we configured earlier. This web page will allow us to visualize the data in a graphical and intuitive manner. You will notice that after data is sent from VS Code, the web page will automatically update and display the visualized data.

   This process enables you to observe the entire workflow from generating mock data to visualizing real-time data through the AWS services we configured.
