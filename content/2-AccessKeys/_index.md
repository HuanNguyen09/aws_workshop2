#### Initializing Access Keys

In this workshop, we will need to interact with AWS using the Command Line Interface (CLI). Therefore, to establish a connection, we need to create Access Keys for this purpose.

#### Initialization Process:
1. On the console page, select your **account name** in the upper right corner. Then choose **Security credentials**.

3. Check the box **"I understand creating a root access key is not a best practice, but I still want to create one."**. Then choose **Create access key**.

4. Here, the **Access Key - Secret access key** information is displayed. We can download it (Download .csv file). Then choose **Save**.

That's it, we have successfully initialized it.
