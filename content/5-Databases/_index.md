In this workshop, we will leverage two essential storage services from Amazon Web Services (AWS): **Amazon DynamoDB** and **Amazon S3**.

**DynamoDB** is used to store processed data from Amazon Kinesis. It's a scalable NoSQL database that enables efficient data storage and querying, supporting complex data management and real-time data analytics.

**S3** is used to store processed and visualized data from the project. Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service with scalability, allowing you to store various types of data such as files, images, videos, and structured data. This data can be easily accessed and shared through links and integrated with other services and applications on the AWS platform.
